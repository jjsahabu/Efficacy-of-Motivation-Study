## Findings

Though we did not obtain statistical significance, we do see some value in this research. Our statistical value was under marginally which can be due to our limited sampling based on budget. With a larger sample with the same results, which we do expect to be similar, we believe we would have obtained significance. We believe that personal incentives (money) are stronger than instrinsic ones such as donating to a charity. This is due partially by the recognition effect as money serves as the primary means of recognition (reward for completing a task vs. no one knowing you donated to a charity).
